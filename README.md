# Adding Jupyter Launcher into Your Chromebook Shelf

## Environment

- OS : Chrome OS >= v69 (, which needs to support for Crostini)

- Jupyter Lab

## How to use

You can use this script with the following:

1. Download SetupJupyterLauncher.sh and modify the file permissions: ```sudo chmod +x ${Directory where you have downloaded the script}/SetupJupyterLauncher.sh``` 

2. Run the script: ```${Directory where you have downloaded the script}/SetupJupyterLauncher.sh```
   
   If you want to use a picture as the icon, then give its full path as the command line argument of the SetupJupyterLauncher.sh : ```${Directory where you downloaded the script}/SetupJupyterLauncher.sh ${the full path of the picture}```
   
The steps make the Jupyter startup icon into your chromebook launcher. So, you only have to pin the Jupyter launcher to shelf: just right-click it and choose "pin to shelf."
